      Shine bright like a diamond
      Shine bright like a diamond
      Find light in the beautiful sea
      I choose to be happy
      You and I, you and I
      We're like diamonds in the sky
      You're a shooting star I see
      A vision of ecstasy
      When you hold me, I'm alive
      We're like diamonds in the sky
      I knew that we'd become one right away
      Oh, right away
      At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
      I saw the life inside your eyes
      So shine bright, tonight you and I
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Eye to eye, so alive
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
      Shining bright like a diamond
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
      Shining bright like a diamond
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Palms rise to the universe
      As we moonshine and molly
      Feel the warmth, we'll never die
      We're like diamonds in the sky
      You're a shooting star I see
      A vision of ecstasy
      When you hold me, I'm alive
      We're like diamonds in the sky
      At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
      I saw the life inside your eyes
      So shine bright, tonight you and I
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Eye to eye, so alive
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
      Shining bright like a diamond
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh)
      Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh)
      Shining bright like a diamond
      We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
      Shine bright like a diamond
      Shine bright like a diamond
      Shine bright like a diamond
      So shine bright, tonight you and I

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight, 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him (him)
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when (when)
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
Little 22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
Whatchu expect me to do?
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool, and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him (him)
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when (when)
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down (well, hear me now)
In central station
Said, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, never thought I'd do it
Oh gosh, what ever happened to me?
Ever happened to me, ever happened to me?
Why did I pull di trigger, pull di trigger, pull di trigger? Boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon
When me pull di trigger, pull di trigger, pull it pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Ayy
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Me say one man down, ah wah me say?
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
Rum-pum-pum-pum
When me went downtown
'Cause now I'm a criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord ah mercy, now I am a criminal, man down
Tell di judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town, none ah dem can see me now, see me now
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

        Brown eyes
        Tuxedo
        Fast cars
        A James Dean on the low
        Dean on the low
        I ask you
        What's the matter
        You say
        Oh, it's nothin' at all
        Heart's racing
        Outta control
        And you knew
        That I couldn't let it go
        You used to be this boy I loved
        And I used to be this girl of your dreams
        Who knew the course of this one drive
        Injured us fatally
        You took the best years of my life
        I took the best years of your life
        Felt like love struck me in the night

        Te amo, te amo
She says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over
Then she said, "Te amo", then she put her hand around me waist
I told her, "No", she cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry
Without asking why, I said, "Te amo"
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over
Then she said, "Te amo", then she put her hand around me waist
I told her, "No", she cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry
Without asking why, I said, "Te amo"
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I'm moving under the light because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way
Then she said, "Te amo", then she put her hand around me waist
I told her, "No", she cried, "Te amo"
I told her, "I'm not gonna run away, but let me go"
My soul is awry
Without asking why, I said, "Te amo"
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
I think it means I love you, I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?
